ðŸ“˜ Data processing a Student Data set with Stream operations:

UML Class chart: https://github.com/Shamelhc1/StudentSystem_DataProcessing_with_Streams/blob/master/StudentSystemUL.png

This project genetates a data set of Random Student, with Course and an Engagement tracker class:
- The data set is mainly generated using Streams.generate() 
- Based on the generated data, I used intermediate and terminal operations to query and extract certain useful data.
- what percentage of male/ female students?
- how many students are in the age range of 30 to 60?
- what are the age statistics of the student data, i.e. average, min, max.
- Are there students that are still active and have been enrolled for more than 7 years
